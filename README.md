## The Battle of Neighborhoods
### Introduction

This is the capstone project of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certification.**

For this capstone project, which is named **The Battle of Neighborhoods**, I decided to carry out the idea suggested by this course for the final assignment, which is to compare the cities of New York and Toronto. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries.

In this repository we will find the following sections:

**1) Description of the problem or idea:** we will have a description of the main idea and a discussion of the backgroud.

**2) Description of the data:** we will have a description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.

**3) Jupyter Notebook:** we will have the code of the data in a Jupyter Notebook.

**4) Report:** we will have a report containing an Introduction, Description of the data, Methodology, Results, Discussions, and Conclusion.
  
I hope you enjoy my work!
